# AudioCutter

A tool to cut audio and generate associated chapters/qpfiles for vapoursynth.

## Known Issues

* Putting 0 at the end of a trim will not work as expected. It probably will just print an error on the video stream
that the trim is invalid, but it may not even do that much. If you want to go to the last frame, for the moment please
specify that last frame number explicitly.

## API

### Functions
**\_\_init\_\_(self)**

Bog standard initialization. There are no possible arguments.

**cut\_audio(self, outfile, video\_source=None, audio\_source=None)**

Cuts the supplied audio file, based on trims from AudioCutter.split()

`video_source` is intended for use with a video type where you've either manually
demuxed an audio track to the same name as your source (e.g. tsmuxer + LSMASHSource),
or generated an index file that demuxes the audio in a very similar way 
(e.g dgindex + d2v.Source). It will search for filenames that begin with the video name,
but have an aac or ac3 extension, as these are the most likely output from those types
of sources (DVDs/Transport streams). It always uses the largest available file, so don't
use this option if for some reason you have ac3 and aac files that are similar to your
source name, unless you're sure you want the ac3, as it will be bigger. This is mutually
exclusive with audio_source.

`audio_source` simply takes an audio file name, in case your audio isn't so strictly named
like your video. This is mutually exclusive with video_source.

`outfile` should be fairly straightforward.

**ready\_qp\_and\_chapters(self, vid)**

Populates qp_lines and chapters based on frames passed to split()

This function is kept separate from split() in case of framerate change.
The obvious use case is after inverse telecine, where this must be called
after decimation. 

The chapters created will be bog standard OGM chapters format, defaulting to
Chapter NN for the names if chapter_names has not been set. Also, if there are
more split points than names supplied, it will exhaust the list first and then
start using the defaults.

The chapter timecodes are converted back from the qpfile cut frames, rather than
separately like `vfr.py` used to for avisynth, largely because I don't even know
how those timecodes came about, but also because this ensures a chapter jump will
go to the exact spot with a forced IDR point. While this may not always be perfectly
frame accurate in an ivtc context, having them match and be off by one is better than
potentially having the chapter IDR point one frame later than the chapter start 
timecode.

**split(self, vid, trims)**

Takes a list of 2-tuples of frame numbers and returns the trimmed/spliced video.

The 2-tuples must have positive frame numbers, and the second member must be greater
than the first. The end frame number is inclusive, like avisynth, but unlike standard
slicing in vapoursynth. As a result, avisynth's:

    trim(9536,22662)++trim(25360,36238)++trim(38038,47896)

is exactly analagous to:

    split(video_in, [(9536,22662),(25360,36238),(38038,47896)]

Fancy list slicing, inverse stride, skipping frames, and other similar tricks you can
trivially pull with vapoursynth directly don't make much sense in this context, so they
simply will not work.

**write_chapters(self, outfile)**

Writes chapters to outfile.

Obviously, this is of limited use if you have not run `ready_qp_and_chapters()`,
as the default is an empty string, but that operation should succeed.

**write_qpfile(self, outfile)**

Writes qp_lines to outfile.

Obviously, this is of limited use if you have not run `ready_qp_and_chapters()`,
as the default is an empty string, but that operation should succeed.

### Instance variables
**chapter\_names** - The list of names to populate the NAME field in your chapters file. Optional

**chapters** - A string containing the lines for a chapter file. Of limited value given `write_chapters()`

**cut\_cmd** - The mkvmerge command(s) that will be called, to show the timecodes.

>Do note that the actual cutting method modifies this further, though not
>the timecodes. If you just want to ensure that it's cutting in the right
>spot, this is fine after cut_audio()

>Note that this command will come with two format string variables, 
>`{0}` for the input filename, and `{1}` for the output. `cut_audio()` handles
>this for you though.

`qp_lines` - A string containing the lines for a qpfile. Of limited value given `write_qpfile()`
